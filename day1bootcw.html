                <h4>Amelia Earhart</h4>
                <p>Amelia Earhart (1897â€“1937) was a groundbreaking American aviator and author who captured the world's attention with her historic flights. In 1932, she became the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean, earning the Distinguished Flying Cross. A strong advocate for women's equality, Earhart co-founded The Ninety-Nines, an organization for female pilots, and challenged societal norms throughout her life. In 1937, while attempting to be the first woman to circumnavigate the globe, her plane mysteriously disappeared over the Pacific Ocean, cementing her legacy as a fearless and inspirational figure.</p>
